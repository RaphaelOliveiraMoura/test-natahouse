</p>

Consists in create a application that display how many stops are necessary to a starship complete a journey.

Using the public [Star Wars API](https://swapi.co/), to integrate with the application.

### Application

Was developed a application that list all starships presents on starwars films, and for each starship you can see more details about it and calculate **how many stops are necessary to complete a journey** with any distance provided by user.

Is important say that I never saw any star wars film before, so I don't understand nothing about this universe.
